# Tile by Nehir – Bootstrap Layout Starter

Welcome to your Bootstrap layout activity! This project is part of **LiveLab 5** in the Global Career Accelerator. You’ll be building a responsive image layout inspired by a fictional design studio called _Tile by Nehir_.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to structure a webpage using **Bootstrap’s grid system**
- How to use **Bootstrap utility classes** to control spacing, alignment, and responsiveness
- How to combine Bootstrap with a few **custom styles**
- How to prompt AI tools like **ChatGPT** or **Copilot** to help you improve layout, debug issues, or style your code

---

## 🚀 How to Preview Your Code in Codespaces

We’ve set up a **starter page (`index.html`)** to help you easily open the right file in Live Server.

1. In the file list, find and right-click `index.html`
2. Choose **"Preview with Live Server"**
3. You’ll see two links:
   - `🖼️ Tile by Nehir Starter`: for your Bootstrap layout activity
   - `🌀 Parallax Level-Up`: LEVEL UP for an optional scroll effect challenge

You do **not** need to open the other `index-nehir.html` or `index-parallax.html` files directly.

---

> 💡 We renamed those files to keep things organized and help Live Server route things cleanly.

## 🔧 During the LiveLab

Your starter includes:

- A styled heading using **Playfair Display** and a background color
- Four stacked tile images, each with spacing (`mb-3`)
- Custom CSS already applied

But it’s **not responsive… yet.**

In the LiveLab, your instructor will guide you through:

- **Adding the Bootstrap CDN link** to activate Bootstrap classes
- Using the Bootstrap **grid system** (`container`, `row`, `col-*`) to create a responsive layout
- Applying **utility classes** like `img-fluid`, `g-4`, or `text-center`
- Prompting **AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot** to debug layout or explore enhancements

> 👀 You’ll see how one line of Bootstrap can dramatically change the layout.
>
> 📌 You can follow along _live_ and add the code step-by-step  
> **OR** wait until after the demo and try it on your own with your team.

## 👩‍💻 In Teams: What You’ll Do

Once in breakout rooms:

1. Use the provided starter code to build your tile layout
2. Apply **Bootstrap grid classes** to make it responsive
3. Use **utility classes** to add spacing, padding, and image styling
4. Use at least **one AI prompt** from the Resource Doc to improve layout or solve a styling issue
5. Optionally: Add hover effects, background color, or wrap each image in a card

## ✅ Core Goals

- [ ] Your layout should work well on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Use Bootstrap’s `container`, `row`, and column classes like `col-12`, `col-sm-6`, or `col-md-4` to build your layout.
- [ ] At least 1 layout or style enhancement should come from an AI suggestion
- [ ] Be ready to share what you built and what AI helped you with!

---

## 💬 Questions to Discuss as a Team

- What Bootstrap classes helped make your layout responsive?
- What did AI suggest that you kept, changed, or ignored?
- What was the biggest challenge you had to debug or figure out?
